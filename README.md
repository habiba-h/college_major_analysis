Regression models - association of college major with income

How income varies across different categories of college majors. 
Question: Based on your analysis, would you conclude that there is a significant association between college major category and income?

Answer: Yes

Explanation: I used median income as the dependent variable and major category, coded as a factor variable, for the predictor to fit a linear model. 
The p-values for all the factor variables for major categories are significant. 
The residuals are identically distributed and uncorrelated to the fitted value. 
Hence, the major category has a significant association with median income.
